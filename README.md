# ELEC4630 Assignment 3 - Deep Learning Assignment

## Here are Some Resources to Complete this Assignment

For the first time, I will attempt to give all my students on online preconfigured linux server with root access and GPU acceleration via a GitHub Classroom.Â Â  Your computer will come preconfigured with an introduction to Git and the entire set of notebooks for our fastai course written by Prof Jeremy Howard.Â  He has literally written the book on AI.Â  The latest version of his course was recorded live at UQ. 

### Resources

[Practical Deep Learning Course](https://course.fast.ai/)

[How to setup a Personal Blog on GitHub](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html)

[Tutorial on GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/a/WQ2cYhvn)

[Notebooks for fastai Course](https://classroom.github.com/a/55q09ppO)

[Assignment 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/bFnkoIfT)

### Software to Install on your own PC

[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)

[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

[Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

I suggest you install repositories on Google Drive after downloading `Drive for Desktop`.  Then the files are easy to access on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 

### Software to install on your phone

Install the GitHub app on iOS or Android phones. It is available in the App Store or Google Play. This app is used for browsing repositories and also for authorizing potentially dangerous actions such as deleting repositories. 


### Codespaces to run your Notebooks etc

Create your personal virtual Deep Learning PC running Linux.

First create a codespace for this repository by clicking this ðŸ‘‡ 

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=master&repo=635322441)

You should see the following message at the top of the page: `Codespace usage for this repository is paid for by lovellbrian`.  Your GitHub account now has access to both `Codespaces` and `Copilot` through the wonderful GitHub Classroom Program which is worth about $15 a month commercially. 

Select **Branch:main, Region: South East Asia, and Machine: 2 core**

Then click `Create Codespace`.  After a few minutes you will have a brand new shiny Linux machine to play with.  The machine will be removed if you don't use it for 30 days, but you can always create a new one.  Its machine state and files are retained after exiting - just like a real PC. You can also leave the PC running to perform long Deep Learning training runs. 

# How to find your Codespaces machine again

You can find your Codespaces machine by clicking on `Codespaces` in the black top menubar of Github to the right of the logo.  

# Try out a Notebook

Accept this Assignment Invitation
[Notebooks for fastai Course](https://classroom.github.com/a/55q09ppO)

Open the `getting-started-with-codespaces.md` file, and create a codespace for the fastai repository by clicking `Open in GitHub Codespaces` as before.

Now try opening the `00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb` notebook.  Click on the notebook cells in order to run the code and try to understand what is going on. 

## How to find your Assignment again

Class Assignments are visible in your GitHub dashboard, but do not show up under your repositories in your profile as you are not the owner.  You see them when you your dashboard in GitHub. Access your dashboard anytime by clicking on the GitHub logo at the top-left of any page. 

Assignments will have a name of the form `The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/assignment-3-solution-repository-\<yourGitHubName\>` and will have a UQ logo.  

## Fetching Updates on the Assignment Respository

I may need to update this assignment from time to time.  If you want to refresh your repository, I have not found an easy way to sync the files.  One way that does work is to first delete your Assignment repository, and then re-accept the inviitation. This checks out a fresh copy of the files. 

## Solution Code for Submission

Please place your Assignment 3 solution code in this repository in the folder `YourSolutions`. We can run and check your solutions remotely.

**Good Luck!**
