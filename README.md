## Here are some Resources to Complete this Assignment

For the first time, I will attempt to give all my students on online preconfigured linux server with root access and GPU acceleration via a GitHub Classroom.   Your computer will come preconfigured with an introduction to Git and the entire set of notebooks for our fastai course written by Prof Jeremy Howard.  He has literally written the book on AI.  The latest version of his course was recorded live at UQ.

- [How to setup a Personal Blog on GitHub](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html)
- [Tutorial on GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/a/WQ2cYhvn)
- [Notebooks for fastai Course](https://classroom.github.com/a/55q09ppO)

## Software to Install on your own PC

- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

I suggest you install your repositories on Google Drive after downloading *Drive for Desktop*.  Then the files are easy to access on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 

## Software to Install on your Phone

Install the GitHub app on iOS or Android phones. It is available in the App Store or Google Play. This app is used for browsing repositories and also for authorizing potentially dangerous actions such as deleting repositories. 


## Codespaces to run your Notebooks

Create your personal virtual Deep Learning PC running Linux in *Codespaces*.

Accept these 3 Assignment Invitations. Repositories created by invitation links are all called *Assignments* in GitHub Classroom.

- [Assignment 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/bFnkoIfT) - this is where you develop your solutions
- [Notebooks for fastai Course](https://classroom.github.com/a/55q09ppO) - these are the notebooks for fastai
- [Tutorial on GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/a/WQ2cYhvn) - learn to use Git and GitHub

This will creates 3 repositories in your GitHub Account of the form
- The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/assignment-3-solution-repository-\<yourGitHubName>
- The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/fastai-course-\<yourGitHubName>
- The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/git-github-fundamentals-\<yourGitHubName>

These assignment repositories are visible in your GitHub dashboard, but do not show up as your own repositories in your profile as you are not the owner.  However, you see them in your dashboard in GitHub. Access your dashboard anytime by clicking on the GitHub logo at the top-left of any page. 

 - Select the *The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/fastai-course-<yourGitHubName>* repository in GitHub
- Click on the Green `Code` button
- Select `Codespaces`
- Click on the Green  `Create Codespaces on Main` button.  

You should see the following message at the top of the page: *Codespace usage for this repository is paid for by lovellbrian*.  Your GitHub account now has access to both *Codespaces* and *Copilot* through the wonderful *GitHub Classroom Program* which is worth about $15 a month commercially. 

Select *Branch:main, Region: South East Asia, and Machine: 8 core*

Then click *Create Codespace*.  After a few minutes you will have a brand new shiny Linux machine to play with.  if you don't use it for 30 days, the machine is removed, but you can always create a new one.  Its machine state and files are retained after exiting - just like a real PC. You can also leave the PC running to perform long Deep Learning training runs. 

## How to find your Codespaces Machine again

You can find your Codespaces machine by clicking on *Codespaces* in the black top menubar of Github to the right of the logo.  

## Try out your First fastai Notebook

Now try opening the *00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb* notebook in *The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/fastai-course-<yourGitHubName>* repository.  Click on the notebook cells in order to run the code and try to understand what is going on. 

You can build codespaces for any other repositories as well. 

## Fetching Updates on the Assignment Repositories

I may need to update assignments from time to time.  If you want to refresh your repository do as follows:

1. First delete your Assignment repository in GitHub

   - Select the *The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/assignment-3-solution-repository-<yourGitHubName>* repository in GitHub

   - Click on Settings/General and scroll to the bottom until you find *Delete Repository*

1. Then Accept the Assignment invitation again to fetch the updated Assignment template.

## I Deleted the Wrong Repository

Fear not. This is easily fixed as I just found out.

- Click on your user icon in the top right corner of GitHub
- Select `Settings` from the drop down
- Now click `Repositories` in the left menu
- Click on `Deleted Repositories` and select `Restore`

## Solution Code for Submission

Please place your Assignment 3 solution code in the folder *YourSolutions* in the*The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/assignment-3-solution-repository-<yourGitHubName>* repository. We can run and check your solutions remotely from there.



# Good Luck!
