# ELEC4630-Assignment-3
Deep Learning Assignment

## Here are some resources to complete this assignment

For the first time, I will attempt to give all my students on online preconfigured linux server with root access and GPU acceleration via a GitHub Classroom.   Your computer will come preconfigured with an introduction to Git and the entire set of notebooks for our fastai course written by Prof Jeremy Howard.  He has literally written the book on AI.  The latest version of his course was recorded live at UQ. 

### Resources

[Practical Deep Learning Course](https://course.fast.ai/)

[How to setup a Personal Blog on GitHub](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html)

[Tutorial on GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/a/WQ2cYhvn)

### Software to Install on your own PC

[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)

I suggest you install repositories on Google Drive after downloading **Drive for Desktop**.  Then the files are easy to access on [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 


### Codespaces to run your Notebooks etc

Click this link [Notebooks for fastai Course](https://classroom.github.com/a/55q09ppO)

Make or link your free [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

Open your account and you should see a repository of the form: **The-University-of-Queensland-Lovell/fastai-course-\<your_GitHub_username\>**

Open the repository and then open the file **getting-started-with-codespaces.md**

Click on the link **Open with GitHub Codespaces**

You should see the follwing message at the top of the page: **Codespace usage for this repository is paid for by lovellbrian**

Create your personal virtual Deep Learning PC running Linux.

Try running the **00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb** notebook.

## How to find your Assignment again

Class Assignments are visible in your GitHub dashboard, but do not show up under your repositories in your profile as you are not the owner.  You see them when you your dashboard in GitHub. Access your dashboard anytime by clicking on the GitHub logo at the top-left of any page.
