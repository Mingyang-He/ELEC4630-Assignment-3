# ELEC4630-Assignment-3
Deep Learning Assignment

## Here are some resources to complete this assignment

For the first time, I will attempt to give all my students on online preconfigured linux server with root access and GPU acceleration via a GitHub Classroom.   Your computer will come preconfigured with an introduction to Git and the entire set of notebooks for our fastai course written by Prof Jeremy Howard.  He has literally written the book on AI.  The latest version of his course was recorded live at UQ.
